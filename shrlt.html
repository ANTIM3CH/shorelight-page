        <h2>About the band</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PathosATL">SHORELIGHT</a> 
          is a 1 piece metalcore outfit from the bowels of East
          Cobb county. With roots planted deep from the realm of smooth
          jazz, as well as competative Scandinavian hog whistling. All the
          way to disheartening doom sludge dad pop. SHORELIGHT most
          definitely has a style all their own. From the age of 3
          songwriter/performer/whistler, Austin "Big Booty Doodie" Self has
          been hand widdling his own instruments. Such as, the flute,
          trombone, 9 string guitar, the hurdy gurdy and many more. With
          this craftmanship and practice, as well as a strict diet of Bush's
          Baked Beans, he is the absolute portrait of peak physical and
          mental ability. All of these attributes combine in a sultry swirl
          of putrid yet ambrosial ambience that is sure to dance all over
          your tingling jiggly bits. Click

            <div>
              Terraformed into abomination
              The road to hell is paved with civilization
              They will drown in the world depleted
              Smoke rises from the garden of Eden
            </div><br>
            
            <div>
              Self inflicted planetary genocide
              Babtized in flame and rising tide
              Seven billion march toward suicide
              Hang your head in shame
              Look in the mirror there is no one else to blame
              No restitution for a species extinguished
              You refuse to relinquish control
              All burns in the fires of industry
              All hail our great kingdom of dead machings
              Pedal to the floor towards mass extinction
              Global asphyxiation
              Weeping and gnashing of teeth
              This is hell
            </div><br>
            
            <div>
              Reaking havok in our wake
              A wasteland remains
              Everything to lose, nothing to gain
              Goddamn the human race
              Blackened out sun at the hands of humans
              A wasteland remains
              This is what we create
              Goddamn the human race

              Choked out life

              When will you begin to understand
              Wnen your children are starving and gasping for air?
              All burns in the fires of industry
              All hail our great kingdom of dead machings
              This is hell

              The lust we crave
              The convenience we need
              Has left us the last of a dying breed
              The eye that sees
              The webs we weave
              The abyss I stare into stares back into me
